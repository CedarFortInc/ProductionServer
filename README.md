This server is designed to smooth the process of creating and tracking metadata in a flexible graph-database. This allows for better tracking of comp-titles and smoother responses to the changing demands of the book industry. 

To make a fresh install:
* Unpack and install the included copy of neo4j community under /data.
* `npm install`
* Run with `npm start`
* Graceful shutdown with any of your favorite `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` methods or `npm stop`.
